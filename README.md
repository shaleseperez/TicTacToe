# Tic Tac Toe :x: :o: 

## This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game created with React

### How to Run
* Download the zip and extract the files (Or fork the repository and fetch the files)
* Run the following commands from the root folder: `npm install http-server` (if you do not have it installed) and then `http-server -c-1` to start the server
* Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

### Roadmap of Future Improvements 
* Add animations for square selection, winner alert, resetting the board etc.
* Add a game mode with the option to play the standard game or a challenge mode that tracks the winner over 3 games (best 2 out of 3)
